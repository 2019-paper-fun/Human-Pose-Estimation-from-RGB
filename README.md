# Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera - The repo
In recent years, tremendous amount of progress is being made in the field of Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera, which is an interdisciplinary field that fuses computer vision, deep/machine learning and medicine. This repo is for my study notes and will be used as a place for triaging new research papers.
