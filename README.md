# Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera - The repo
In recent years, tremendous amount of progress is being made in the field of Human Pose Estimation from RGB Camera, which is an interdisciplinary field that fuses computer vision, deep/machine learning and medicine. This repo is for my study notes and will be used as a place for triaging new research papers. 

## Get Involved
To make it a collaborative project, you may add content through pull requests or open an issue to let me know. 

## Table of Contents

I'll use the following icons and dimensions to differentiate the approaches:

- Time Dimension
	- :camera: Single-Shot 
	- :movie_camera: Real-Time
- Number of People
	- :one: Single-Person
	- :1234: Multi-Person
- Spatial Dimensions
	- [2D Models](#2d_models)
	- [3D Models](#3d_models)
